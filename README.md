# Hello, I'm Stanley

I am a Full Stack Developer working at Booz Allen Hamilton. I am a self-taught programmer. I was previously working in IT and I began my journey to programming on October 27th, 2019.

# About the website

## Tech Stack

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

## structure

The directory structure within the 'src' folder is...

### Directories

- components: stores all the components separately for easier management.
- data: store all related data to be accessed.
- pages: stores all separate pages. Since this is an only page, there is currently only one file in here.
- images: All images such as logos, backgrounds, and images are stored here.
- styles: stores all the css styles. I have it separated between global, desktop, tablet, and mobile css stylesheets.

## Development Process

I followed the mobile-first-design to first design for the smallest screen first and gradually working up to larger screen sizes.

I used CSS Flexbox to handle most of the alignment since all items I wanted to position were laid out on a single axis (either horizontally or vertically).

## To-Do's

### Optional

- style sidebar

About Me

I graduated Old Dominion University with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems & Technology and after five years of working in IT industry, I've developed a strong foundation in technology. Overtime, I came to the realization that it wasn't the career path that aligned with my passion. With a desire to explore another area of the tech industry and expand my skillset, I made the decision to pivot my career to software development on October 27th, 2019. Through extensive self-study and hands-on practice, I've developed a passion for programming and I've immersed myself in learning new technologies and best practices. As I've on this new chapter, I'm eager to leverage my existing knowledge and experience while continuing to grow and develop as a software developer.
