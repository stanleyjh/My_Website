I first created my personal website using WordPress with the elementor plugin and Bluehost as the web hosting service. I was limited on how I could customize the site as well as paying a fee to have my website hosted. Today, my website is hosted on Github using React, JavaScript, CSS and HTML allowing me to configure everything and save on hosting costs. I purchased the domain name through google domains.

## Programming Languages

React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML

## Structure

The directory structure within the 'src' folder...

- assets: My resume and image files such as logos, project images, background, profile pictures, etc.
- components: All react components for every section.
- data: Data files to reference.
- pages: Stores all web pages. Currently, there is a single page.
- styles: CSS styles. I have it separated between desktop and mobile css stylesheets.

## Development Process

Structure:

1. I created a tree structure outline for my website of how I wanted to place the headings, text, and images.
2. I created the directories for structure, assets, and styles.
3. I created React components for each section and built one section at a time.
4. I moved some of the static content such as the Projects section over to the data.js file. That way I can add new project information in data.js and the Projects component would automatically display the updated content.

Styling: I followed a mobile-first-design. I began designing for a mobile screen first and then designing for a tablet/desktop screen. I used CSS Media Query for the screen to apply CSS styling based on the screen width. Mobile (max-width: 767px), tablet/desktop (min-width: 768px).
