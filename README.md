# Portfolio

I first created my personal website using WordPress with the elementor plugin and Bluehost as the web hosting service. I was limited on how I could customize the site as well as paying a fee to have my website hosted. Today, my website is hosted on Github using React, JavaScript, CSS and HTML allowing me to configure everything and save on hosting costs. I purchased the domain name through google domains.

## Programming Languages

React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML

## Structure

The directory structure within the 'src' folder...

- assets: My resume and image files such as logos, project images, background, profile pictures, etc.
- components: All react components for every section.
- data: Data files to reference.
- pages: Stores all web pages. Currently, there is a single page.
- styles: CSS styles. I have it separated between global, desktop, tablet, and mobile css stylesheets.

## Development Process

Structure:

1. I created a tree structure outline for my website of how I wanted to place the headings, text, and images.
2. I created the directories for structure, assets, and styles.
3. I created a basic component for each section and started building one section at a time.
4. I moved some of the static content such as the Projects section over to the data.js file. That way I can add new project information in data.js and the Projects component would automatically display the new project.

Styling: I followed a mobile-first-design. I began designing for a mobile screen first and gradually worked up to the tablet and desktop screen. For styles that applied to all screen sizes, I placed the styles within the global.css file.

## Optional To-Do's

- Add a button to go back up to the hero section when scrolling down.
- Add a Contact Me page.
