# Hello, I'm Stanley

I am a Full Stack Developer working at Booz Allen Hamilton. I am a self-taught programmer. I was previously working in IT and I began my journey to programming on October 27th, 2019.

I first created my personal website using WordPress with the elementor plugin and Bluehost to host my website. I decided to create my own website using React, JavaScript, CSS and HTML to be able to be able to configure everything and save on hosting costs.

# About the website

## Tech Stack

React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML

## structure

The directory structure within the 'src' folder is...

### Directories

- components: stores all the components separately for easier management.
- data: store all related data to be accessed.
- pages: stores all separate pages. Since this is an only page, there is currently only one file in here.
- images: All images such as logos, backgrounds, and images are stored here.
- styles: stores all the css styles. I have it separated between global, desktop, tablet, and mobile css stylesheets.

## Development Process

I followed the mobile-first-design to first design for the smallest screen first and gradually working up to larger screen sizes.

I used CSS Flexbox to handle most of the alignment since all items I wanted to position were laid out on a single axis (either horizontally or vertically).

## To-Do's

### Optional

- style sidebar

About Me

I graduated Old Dominion University with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems & Technology and after five years of working in IT industry, I've developed a strong foundation in technology. Overtime, I came to the realization that it wasn't the career path that aligned with my passion. With a desire to explore another area of the tech industry and expand my skillset, I made the decision to pivot my career to software development on October 27th, 2019. Through extensive self-study and hands-on practice, I've developed a passion for programming and I've immersed myself in learning new technologies and best practices. As I embark on this new chapter, I'm eager to leverage my existing knowledge and experience while continuing to grow and develop as a software developer.
